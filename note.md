### The Washington DNR fire dashboard is a situational awareness and decision support tool for state fire managers. We made this application open access to encourage public and other agency benefit and hope you find it useful!

1. Region specific views (region users will be able to select their region and all data will filter for just that region)

2. Current weather and forecast information (pretty heavy lift, and weather forecast data is costly but will see)

3. Continuous improvement of graphs and other displays. Map layers as needed

4. Hopefully automated integration with InFORM/EIRS in 2021

5. Aviation section - add Survey123 form for him, PDF upload capability (need to check with Dave Richie). map this to a Aviation Report Button

6. Remove Responses from Dashboard??????

7. Redo the summary table, get more input from Sarah

| Location | DNR Fires  | Other Agency Assists | False Alarms | Total Responses |
|----------|------------|----------------------|--------------|-----------------|

8. Fix labels on Graph
9. Add a new graphic which shows the monthly average and the total fire count and acres by Month (aggregation by month!)
10. Make the splash screen editable - nice to have
11. IROC Integration with IRWIN - total resources, pull 2021 Wildfire Fire Locations (NIFC Open Data)
12. NWCC Totals Fields - updated by Survey123 or by IRWIN fire locations
13. Real time count of fire starts - auto-combining the Survey123 forms from Regions, logic 24hrs and 48hr - may be challenging
14. Change wording of "Current Large Fires" to "Current Active Large fires"
15. Aviation table - add column of "Scoopers" 
16. Measurement Tool add to the map
