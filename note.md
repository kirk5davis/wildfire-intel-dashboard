1. Region specific views (region users will be able to select their region and all data will filter for just that region)

2. Current weather and forecast information (pretty heavy lift, and weather forecast data is costly but will see)

3. Continuous improvement of graphs and other displays. Map layers as needed

4. Hopefully automated integration with InFORM/EIRS in 2021
